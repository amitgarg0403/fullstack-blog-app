## Reflection
It was a side Blog project for learning purpose only. based on MERN stack where a User can Authenticate themselves with Options to upload images with Post.

  - Based on `MERN` Stack
  - Used `ReactJS` library as Frontend, `NodeJS` and `ExpressJS` as Backend and `MongoDB` as Database.
  - Tried to implement Material UI design with ReactJS
  - Project consist of main 3 components
      - `Mainpage` component will display a blog post with title, category, description and image(optional). On bottomside it also display Name of Author with timestamp.
      - `Sidebar` component will display list of all blog post with brief of title, category, description with `Edit` and `Delete` button.
      - `CriteriaBlock` component will be responsible for `Sort` and `Filter` functionality on SideBar. 
  - On top `Navbar` is there which display `create` link for new Blog Post and also it displays Name of User logged in and Logout option.
